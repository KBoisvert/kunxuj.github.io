Currently, there is a "trend" that if you don't claim your API as "restful", it seems that your API is not a real API. Although I don't think I'm fashion catcher in every popular terms such as J2ee, SOA, etc.  I admit that restful api can provided obvious benefits and claiming your API as "restful" also provide some benefits to developers. 

Since there is no standard for defining "restful", there are some arguments about if some APIs is restful or not. 

One argument is "restful API should have pretty URI", 

Since, I'm providing a query API similar to [MongoDB resful API](),  it obviously doesn't look pretty, I feel a little bit low. 

However, after I searched the Internet and specially after watched a video [""](), I feel a little bit strong, at least, I can ask: why my api is not restful?

The aforementioned video also give the explanation about when to use version number in the URL, I do agree that if no for versioning of resources, don't break API after some software upgrade!
