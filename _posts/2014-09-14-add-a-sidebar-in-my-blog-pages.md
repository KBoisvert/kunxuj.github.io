Before I write more blogs, I think it's better to add a sidebar to my blog pages for better categorizing my blogs, like a lot of other blog sites do on the web. Since I'm not familiar to Jekyll and want save time to write more blogs, so I plan to use existing code. After searching on the Internet for a while, finally I found [this site](http://blankego.github.io/index.html) is exactly what I want: it has categories, tags, years for categorizing. 

After study this site's code, I plan to add my own sidebar. 

Since there are a lot of possible tweaks or tries, I think it's a good idea to set up my local (Mac OS X Mavericks) Jekyll environment first to save multiple Git commit and push. 

I ran into some problems when setup local Jekyll environment according to [Jekyll web site](http://jekyllrb.com/)

> * There is an error when run "gem install jekyll", the solution is to run "gem update --system" to update RubyGems
> * There is an error when run "jekyll serve", the solution is to run "gem install github-pages"

To be continue....
