title: My first blog on Github!!
---

I have been interested in writing blogs on Github for a while. However after poked around in some articles on the Internet, I lost patience since they had always asked to setup Jekyii environment locally first (I have so many client devices...) 

Until yesterday, after read one article [Build A Blog With Jekyll And GitHub Pages](http://www.smashingmagazine.com/2014/08/01/build-blog-jekyll-github-pages/), within one hour, I could set my blog site up in Github very easily. I really thank the author for sharing his work.

Next, I will explore the possibilities for using my blog repository with Eclipse (since I'm Eclipse guy) and how to add comments, subfolders in my Github blog site
